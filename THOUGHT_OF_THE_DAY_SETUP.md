# Thought of the Day Feature

This feature provides daily inspirational thoughts for students that automatically rotate based on the date.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 For Students
- **Daily Inspiration**: See a new thought each day on the dashboard
- **Automatic Rotation**: Thoughts change daily based on a predetermined cycle
- **Beautiful Display**: Modern, elegant presentation with author attribution
- **Auto-Reshuffle**: When all thoughts are exhausted, the list reshuffles and starts over

### 🛠️ For Admins & Managers

- **Bulk Import**: Import multiple thoughts at once
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Easy reordering of thoughts
- **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Control which thoughts are in rotation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Seed Initial Thoughts
Run this command in the backend directory to populate 20 sample thoughts:

```bash
cd library-backend
node seed-thoughts.js
```

### 2. Access Management
- **Admins & Managers** can access thought management via the "Thoughts" menu item
- **Students** will automatically see the thought of the day on their dashboard

## 🎨 How It Works

### Daily Rotation Algorithm
- Thoughts are ordered by their `order` field (drag & drop to reorder)
- Each day shows a different thought based on a deterministic algorithm
- Uses days since epoch (Jan 1, 2024) to ensure consistency
- When the list is exhausted, it automatically loops back to the beginning

### Example Rotation
If you have 20 thoughts:
- Day 1: Thought #1
- Day 2: Thought #2
- ...
- Day 20: Thought #20
- Day 21: Thought #1 (loops back)

## 📝 Managing Thoughts

### Adding Single Thoughts
1. Go to **Thoughts** in the admin menu
2. Click **"Add Thought"**
3. Enter the thought text and author
4. Click **"Add Thought"**

### Bulk Import
1. Click **"Bulk Import"**
2. Enter thoughts in the text area, one per line
3. Use format: `"Thought text" - Author Name` or just `Thought text`
4. Click **"Import Thoughts"**

### Reordering
- Simply drag and drop thoughts to reorder them
- The order determines the rotation sequence

### Managing Active Status
- Click the eye icon (👁️) to toggle thoughts active/inactive
- Only active thoughts appear in the daily rotation

## 🎯 Student Experience

When students log in, they see:
- A beautiful **"Thought of the Day"** section instead of the old role message
- The current day's inspirational thought with author attribution
- A lightbulb icon (💡) indicating inspiration
- Elegant typography with quotation marks and attribution
